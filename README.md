# Predicting Bank Customer Churn
This project aims to predict bank customers likely to churn based on a dataset containing personal information, transaction data, and banking details. By identifying potential churners, banks can proactively engage with these customers to retain them and prevent significant financial withdrawals.

- Developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to classify customers likely to churn.
- Leveraged Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
- Designed insights to help banks devise strategies for improving customer loyalty and retention.
